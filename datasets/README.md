## SemEval-2018 Task 3 datasets ##

In this repository you will find the datasets for SemEval-2018 Task 3:

* Example datasets (Task A and Task B) + trial dataset Task A
* Training datasets (Task A and Task B)
* Test datasets (Task A and Task B) - to be released in January 2018

## IMPORTANT ##
Please be aware of the fact that this folder contains three versions of the training sets for Task A and Task B:
1. SemEval2018-T3-train-taskA.txt and SemEval2018-T3-train-taskB.txt
2. SemEval2018-T3-train-taskA\_emoji.txt and SemEval2018-T3-train-taskB\_emoji.txt
3. SemEval2018-T3-train-taskA\_emoji\_ironyHashtags.txt and SemEval2018-T3-train-taskB\_emoji\_ironyHashtags.txt

In 1) we replaced emoji by UTF8 descriptions and removed irony-related hashtags as these hashtags will not be present in the test set.
2) are the datasets with the original emoji, as asked for by some participants.
3) are the original datasets, i.e., without preprocessing of emoji and including the irony hashtags with which they were originally collected.

NOTE:
* The test set will be provided in two flavours: A) with emoji and B) with emoji replaced by descriptions or aliases. Participants choose either one of them depending on the training set they used.
* Irony-related hashtags will <b>NOT</b> be present in the test set.
